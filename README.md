## Installation <a name="installation"></a>

This code runs with Python version 3.* and requires some libraries, to install theses libraries you will need to execute: </br>
` pip install -r requirements.txt `

You will need to download Stackoverflowï¿½s 2018 and 2019 Annual Developer Survey and put in specific folders. You can find the data to download [here](https://insights.stackoverflow.com/survey). </br>

## Project Motivation <a name="motivation"></a>

I am interested in using Stackoverflow Developer Survey Data to better understand Programming usage trends:</br>

1. What programming languages in the last 5 years are most widely used and how have they changed in usage across those years? </br>
2. What are some of the fastest growing and declining programming languages used by developers in the past 5 years? </br>
3. What new programming languages have emerged and how have they grown in usage? </br>
